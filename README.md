**Alertify Plugin**

The Alertify plugin is a valuable tool designed to enhance the engagement and performance of students within an educational course. It serves as an automated notification system, with the primary objective of reminding students about incomplete activities in the course. The plugin operates on a recurring schedule, sending reminders via email at four-day intervals to prompt students to complete their outstanding coursework.

**How it Works:**

1. **Scheduled Reminders:** The Alertify plugin operates on a predefined schedule, systematically sending email reminders to students who have not completed specific activities within the course. This schedule typically sends reminders every four days, allowing students ample time to catch up on their outstanding tasks.

2. **Customizable Notifications:** One of the key features of Alertify is its flexibility. Educators and administrators can customize the content and format of the notifications. This means that you can tailor the messages to align with the specific needs and tone of your educational institution or course.

3. **Recipient Targeting:** Alertify identifies the students who require reminders based on their activity status. It analyzes the course data to determine which students have not marked an activity as "completed." This ensures that only relevant recipients receive the reminders.

4. **Improved Course Completion:** The overarching goal of Alertify is to boost course completion rates. By gently nudging students to revisit and complete their coursework, it helps improve student engagement, understanding, and overall performance.

5. **Positive Learning Experience:** The automated reminders sent by Alertify aim to create a positive learning experience for students. The gentle and timely reminders serve as a helping hand to students, making sure they do not miss out on valuable learning opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the Alertify plugin is an invaluable addition to any educational platform. It provides an efficient and user-friendly solution to boost course completion rates and enhance the overall learning experience. By sending targeted, customizable reminders every four days to students who have not completed course activities, Alertify empowers educators to support their students in achieving academic success while maintaining their privacy and data security.

This plugin serves as a valuable ally in fostering engagement, facilitating learning, and ensuring that students make the most of their educational opportunities. Whether you're an educator, course administrator, or a student, Alertify is a tool that can significantly enhance the learning journey.
