Summary page in CRM:
Every Staff member should see only the tickets
1) From the projects assingned to the staff
2) The tickets not assigned to any department will be visible to all the staff members

Points:
	Tell Darin to provide an update on the JSON files (Discussed)
		There are some issues in the JSON files basically the users account not being created.
		We have updated the code to use courseid instead of moodleid
		I have to test it soo that it is not having the same issue as the courseid issue present

	Tell Darin to provide an update on the Course Images (Discussed)
		There will be no image if that were not provided in the first place
		We have to give them a design of the course card

	Tell Darin to provide an update on the PDFs Email (Users export email)
		He have seen that and we have to discuss that again using the aggregated excel file

	Tell Darin to provide on the Audios and Videos in the courses (Discussed)
		Darin will provide me a list of the courses according to their moodleid

	Tell Darin to provide on the quizzes in the courses (Discussed)
		I have to check that again as I am seeing that there are some courses without the CE Test

	As you have created new courses. So, which courses needed the Nutrition and Dietetics Feedback.
	If those courses don't needed the Special Feedback than you don't need to create them using the other backup file.
		Darin will just let me know which courses require special feedback

Simplified Points:
	Feedbacks (Done)
	Quizzes (Done) (Need to be checked by me)
	PDFs (Need Respond) (Aggregated Excel File)
	Videos and Audios (Need to confirm) (List will be provided)
	Course Images (Need Respond) (Course Card Design)
	JSON Files (Need Respond) (Will provide the new export file)
